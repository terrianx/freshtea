    - Note: reviews are not saved (refresh the page to reset)
 - Interactive menu
    - Choose a drink and any number of toppings
    - Price is automatically tracked
    - Select options for ice, sugar, and size
    - User can add to cart or clear item
 - Cart system
    - Keeps track of price of all items in cart
    - Displays list of all items in cart
    - User can clear or checkout
    - Note: checkout functionality does not request real payment (checkout button simply clears menu)
