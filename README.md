# FreshTea Website - [Link to Website](https://freshtea.netlify.app/)
A website created to practice HTML, CSS, and JS and learn new frontend skills. I began with HTML and CSS to create a static page. Later I learned and added JS to improve functionality and interactivity. Hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

 - Display images
 - Semantic HTML and website structure
   - Navigation
   - Main with sections and articles
   - Footer
 - Multi-page websites
### 2. CSS
 - Grid layout and positioning
 - UI and UX design
 - Responsiveness
### 3. JS
 - Document object model and accessing specific elements
 - Creating a dynamic web page

## Features

   - Add review in text area and post
   - Note: reviews are not saved (refresh the page to reset)

   - Price is automatically tracked

   - User can add to cart or clear item
 - Cart system
